                  <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                  <p>I am a product leader, entrepreneur and paragon rift runner (Diablo 3, anyone?) with a knack for customer focused product development.  My passion for people, technology and the merger of the two components has permitted me to excel in business product strategy.  I have an extensive background in customer discovery, software integration, leadership and agile methodologies.  These traits have allowed me to lead teams and implement essential lifetime value for customers.</p>
                  <p>I know this role would fit me perfectly since I build webpages for fun. I’ve always enjoyed front end development and spending my evenings learning Javascript.  Development to me is comparable to someone else reading a book.</p>
                  <h4>Where am I from?</h4>
                  <p>Gilbert, AZ</h4>
                  <h4>A day in the life</h4>
                  <h5>Pre-Sales</h5>
                  <p>“Hello Fred, thank you for reaching out to us. Our app currently does not allow live image previews. Is this something you’re looking for in Product Customizer?

We hope that you will find these features useful as we are constantly striving to make our app valuable to our customers. Thanks again for reaching out and please don’t hesitate to contact us with any further questions.”</p>
                  <h5>Fire Alarm</h5>
                  <p>First, I would check my email to see if there are any issues that have been communicated from the company. If there was no email, I would then contact a team member who may have been working already to find out if there is an issue. If I had no response I would start fielding the emails and apologizing for the inconvenience while I worked on communicating with my team to find out what issues we’re having.</p>
                  <h5>Step-by-Step</h5>
                  <p>Haha, this is a funny purchase. My wife wanted to join a Disney DVD club to collect movies for our nephew and nieces. Below are the steps I took to order these DVD’s:</p>
                    <p>1)	Reviewed the Disney Movie Club pamphlet – specifically, I wanted to find out what was required from me when joining. I was also trying to find out how I would order online instead of completing a mail-in form.</p>
                    <p>2)	Found the URL and member code to join the club online instead of mailing</p>
                    <p>3)	Visited the site Disney DVD Club site and entered my special code</p>
                    <p>4)	Selected the movies I wanted to purchase – This was difficult, since my wife wanted specific movies and they were not all available. I chose the movies that were classics so the kids could enjoy timeless movies.</p>
                    <p>5)	Entered my account information (including Name, Address, Credit Card)</p>
                    <p>6)	Reviewed the terms and conditions of my purchase – I reviewed this carefully to ensure that what I thought I was getting when reviewing the pamphlet, was exactly what I was getting.</p>
                    <p>7)	Completed my order</p>
                    <p>8)	Looked for my email confirming the order was complete</p>
