<h1> A Group of Ghoulish and Fun Movie Buffs </h1><br />
Welcome to the home of A Group of Ghoulish and Fun Movie Buffs! We’re a group of friends who love horror movies and science fiction. We want to share our passion for these genres with you through our thoughtful, honest and entertaining film reviews. <br />
<br />
We’ll be giving our thoughts on some of the best and worst horror and sci-fi movies out there, from the classics like Psycho and Alien, to the cult favorites like The Thing and Evil Dead, to the modern masterpieces like Get Out and It Follows. Our reviews will be as fun as they are informative, and we’ll be sure to let you know what we think is worth seeing and what’s best left off your watch list. <br />
<br />
We hope you’ll join us on this scare-filled journey, and have a ghoulishly good time.</body>
